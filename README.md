# Black-Jack
JavaScript, HTML, CSS

Hello, another small project down. This time a Blackjack generator. This Scrimba course was simple yet really engaging. It took my little understanding of JavaScript and greatly expanded it. Allowing me to build foundation in my knowledge and functional ability to program using JS. This project used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with beginner level JS concepts such as,

Arrays 
Objects
Booleans
If else statements
Comparison operators
Logical operators
For loops
The math object
Return statements

 It was such a enlightening experience to actually look back at my code and understand what its doing and why it does it. I also loved customizing the project and actually grasping the concept enough to do so. Scrimba has been a fantastic experience so far. I definitely suggest checking out this course.
